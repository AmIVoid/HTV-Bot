# HTV Bot
## Now with GUI
A quick and dirty python bot to automate collecting coins in the HAnime.tv android app.

# Purpose
I made this because I'm too lazy to open an app every 3 hours to collect coins.

# Disclaimer
I don't recommend anyone uses this bot because it's absolute garbage.

# Running this bot
### In my instance I'm running bluestacks pinned to the top of the display in the corner of my 3rd monitor with HTV always open.

Before running open a command prompt in the folder you extract this to and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To set correct cursor positions click which region you want to change and move your mouse to the area, after 5 seconds the position will be set.
